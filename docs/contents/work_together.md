## Developing as a Team

Building a big shiny app means that several coders will work on that app. So choose tools and structure that will fit collaborative work.

<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Use version control.</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Split your app into pieces so that everybody can work on his own piece (Shiny modules).</li>
</ul>
