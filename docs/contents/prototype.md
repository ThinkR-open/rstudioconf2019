## <span>Prototye</span>

Go "UI first" - define the outline of the app, whithout focusing on the backend. 

<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Will "fix" the app content and fonctionality.</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Can help you see potential pitfalls before it's too late.</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> Once this UI prototype is agreed upon, everybody know where the app is going.</li>
</ul>

The {shinypsum} package has been especially created for that: https://github.com/ThinkR-open/shinipsum
